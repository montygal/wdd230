        <h4>Look at that view!</h4>
        <p>While you're in San Francisco, you'll want to visit the ocean.</p>
        <p>There is a beach called Ocean Beach located in the Golden Gate</p>
        <p>National Parks Conservancy. It's on the west coast and offers some</p>
        <p>of the most breathtaking views around. Everyone loves the ocean,</p>
        <p>and this beach won't disappoint! Don't forget, if you visit in the</p>
        <p>winter months, you'll enjoy the pasttime of storm watching. Usually</p>
        <p>tourists want to go during the summer, but true ocean viewers will take</p>
        <p>advantage of the storm watching activities that only appear during the winter months.</p>
