    <p>I've picked three colors to try and get a feel for what I want the website
        to look like.  The first is CornflowerBlue #6495ED.  I want to include
        blue as one of the main colors for an ocean feel.
    </p>
    <p>The second color is Azure #FOFFFF.  It is an off-white looking color
        that I think will blend nicely with the blue.  I don't want too many
        bold colors, because then my website will be overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>The third color I picked was Brown #A52A2A and I think it complements
        the other two colors nicely.  I want to use it for background borders
        and other important information.
    </p>
