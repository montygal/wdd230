    <h1>Site name: Explore Spaniard's Bay!</h1>
    <p>The site purpose is to draw tourists to Spaniard's Bay, Newfoundland.
        Newfoundland is the Eastern most province of Canada.  Spaniard's Bay is a 
        tiny fishing village in the heart of Newfoundland.  I want to list fun
        activities, local food and sight-seeing opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>The domain name is going to be nfld.info.  It was a suggested name
        for the site when I looked at available domain names.
