    <p>I have two personas.  The first and primary focus is for retirees.
        I want to target things that make them able to take in the scenery
        (like an easy hike), but also account for their age.  The target age is 65+.
        Something I would like to include in the website is a whale watching boat tour.
        The second persona is for families.  There are lots of fun activities
        in the area for families, like picking blueberries and sandy beaches. 
    </p>
    <p>I'm going to call the retirees Elizabeth and Josh Smith.  They have recently
        retired and want to travel.  They want to go somewhere relaxing by the ocean,
        but also somewhere they have never explored before. They are both 66 and have
        always wanted to travel the world.  They want to find places that are a little
        off the map.  Not the first place your mind jumps to when you think of a vacation,
        like Hawaii.
