        <h4>Come discover our small fishing towns!</h4>
        <p>For years, we've built our communities on the tradition</p>
        <p>of fishing. Often passed down through the generations, fishing</p>
        <p>is more than just a job, it's a way of life. There are many</p>
        <p>different fish recipes inspired by the locals, so drop in</p>
        <p>to any of our family owned restaurants to try new dishes,</p>
        <p>such as our famous seal flipper pie.</p>

        <h4>It gets so cold in the winter, we have pack ice on the ocean!</h4>
        <p>Nothing like seeing ice on the ocean! In many areas, it doesn't</p>
        <p>get cold enough to have ice on the ocean, but not here in Newfoundland.</p>
        <p>You can start seeing pack ice as early as October, and more than once</p>
        <p>people have been seen 'trekking' across the ice. Make sure you're dressed</p>
        <p>warm and get safety tips for this exciting excursion from any of the locals.</p>

        <h4>Explore the nooks and crannies and caves of the island!</h4>
        <p>Dotted along our flat coast are all sorts of caves and nooks. It is no</p>
        <p>secret that these beautiful features can be found all over the island.</p>
        <p>People come from all over the world to take in the beauty of Newfoundland,</p>
        <p>and we hope that you will too!</p>

        <h4>Savor the history of the island!</h4>
        <p>Newfoundland was discovered a few hundred years ago by a man</p>
        <p>named John Cabot. It was said that he would dip his nets into</p>
        <p>the ocean, and within minutes, it could be pulled up and be brimming</p>
        <p>with fish. He called it a bountiful land. Newfies are proud of their</p>
        <p>history and the native traditions, such as 'mummering'. Mummering involves</p>
        <p>dressing up as to be unrecognizable to go and sing carols at Chritmas time.</p>

        <h4>Take in the amazing ocean views!</h4>
        <p>Sightseeing is what Newfoundland is all about. It may be a flat island,</p>
        <p>but that just makes the ocean views more accessible! We have sight seeing</p>
        <p>by foot, or by boat. Make sure that if you choose to do a boat excursion, </p>
        <p>you take the time to go whale watching. It is a unique and amazing experience</p>
        <p>that has made Newfoundland popular over the years.</p>
