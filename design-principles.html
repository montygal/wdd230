        <h1>T-Mobile</h1>
        <a href = "https://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>
        <div class = "fort">
        <img src="images/tmobile.jpg"alt=tmobilehomepage>
        </div>
        <p>The design principles I chose are Visual Hierarchy,
            White Space and Clean Design, and PARC: Contrast.
            The websites I chose were T-Mobile, Facebook, and Amazon.
        </p>
        <p>The visual hierarchy in the T-Mobile app uses my name to welcome me.
            I feel that this is a good tactic because it creates a personal invitation
            every time I log in.  It then goes on to offer the latest deals, which the reader
            will naturally read next.  Marketing at it's best.
            The white space is handled well.  Everything is spaced really far apart,
            and the dialog is minimal.
            The contrast is interesting becuase it has a white background, but in the middle
            they have put a solid black background with a picture of one of their latest devices.
            I'm assuming this is to draw consumer's attentions.

        <h1>Facebook</h1>
        <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>
        <div class = "forf">
        <img src="images/facebook.jpg"alt=facebookhomepage>
        </div>
        <p>Facebook is interesting because it loads everything differently every
            time you open it up. It starts by displaying your story, with your profile picture,
            so it is also very personable.  There are a lot of adds as you scroll through,
            and big data collects what you click on so that you see more of similar advertisements.
            The white space is a again very appealing,such as having borders around your personal
            story and those of your friends.  Every new post had it's own block section.
        </p>

    <section>
    <h1>Amazon</h1>
    <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>
    <div class = "fora">
    <img src="images/amazon.jpg"alt=amazonhomepage>
    </div>
    <p>Amazon is very visually appealing.  It lets you know you are in your account,
        and in this particular picture, it promotes the new sequel to Lord of the Rings.
        It shows you things you have in your wish list as a marketing ploy to remind you how
        much you want those things, in the hopes that you will place an order.
        The white space is very well managed, so that everything gets it's own section. The primary
        image is their most recent promotion.
        The contrast works differently because the things in your wish list are all different
        colors, but they have their own blocks so that it doesn't appear so busy.
